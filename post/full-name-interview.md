Computers have always captured my interest, tinkering with my home setups, troubleshooting. I was looking for a way to get involved in the industry, so I took a web design course, it introduced me to basic coding and that sparked my journey into coding.

Working a lot with WordPress, so my familiarity is with the LAMP/MAMP stack as of right now that's my favorite, just because that's what I use.

In the future, I would like to become a proficient backend developer, using languages such as RoR, Python and PHP.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Five years from now I see myself giving back to the community teach the next generation how to code and helping them get a start in the industry. I will have a successful development business that I offer my freelance services through, developing solutions for mid to large sized companies.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?
Stay consistent and stay focused, it's easy to get distracted and let life get in the way of what you really want to accomplish.
